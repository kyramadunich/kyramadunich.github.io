<h1 class="page__title" itemprop="headline">Examining  the Relationship Between Access to Green Space and Rates of Homeownership</h1>

<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline">Introduction + Background</h2>


This analysis aimed to show the relationship between home ownership rates and green space access in Baltimore City, hypothesizing that the two would be positively correlated with each other. Many studies have found a relationship between either wealth and green space access or wealth and homeownership1, 2 ,3 a phenomenon which can be attributed to the fact that property ownership is one of the most powerful tools for wealth building under settler colonialism.4 Facets of property ownership systems such as redlining and blockbusting are used for controlling the land that BIPOC communities inhabit, with the aim of cementing white supremacy5. This system for extracting wealth from land has led to impoverished neighborhoods often having low access to permanently affordable housing as well as green space. Unfortunately, some urban greening projects that appear to be attempting to rectify these inequitable patterns only further cement inequity through a process called “green gentrification” or “urban green grabbing,” during which the development of new or up-and-coming green spaces are accompanied by adjacent luxury, large-scale housing developments that bring an influx of wealthy, often white residents who then displace residents who cannot afford increased living costs.4,6  

Some community development and housing organizations aim to stabilize neighborhoods and prevent gentrification and displacement by facilitating homeownership for low wealth buyers7. In order for environmental organizations to implement greening projects that benefit long term residents and serve the interests of those besides the white and wealthy, they must have an awareness of how their greening projects impact housing, and incorporate  permanently affordable housing into an environmental justice framework. This analysis combines home ownership data with green space data in order to assess how homeownership rates correlate with current patterns of proximity to green space. 

<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline">Data</h2>

For this analysis, the green space data came from the Maryland Department of Planning’s (MDP) 2010 Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) product8, and the homeownership rates data came from the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS)9.

Figure 1: Univariate choropleth map showing % rate of home ownership with green spaces in Baltimore, MD. A univariate choropleth map shades predetermined areas (in this case, census tracts) based on the value of a single variable corresponding to that area. Figure 1 maps percent rate of homeownership; the darker the shade, the higher the rate of homeownership. The most important decision to make in a choropleth map is where the cut-offs for each category are. I chose to use the Jenks natural breaks classification method,  which minimizes within-group variance and maximize between-group variance. However, this didn’t necessarily produce the most accurate categories for what a “low” and “high” ownership rate is, so it's important to remember that these categories shouldn’t be interpreted as set in stone.

 Figure 2: Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) Between Rate of Homeownership and Percent Cover of Green Space. Of the 199 points census tracts, 84 showed a significant relationship between the percent rate of homeownership and the percent cover of green space, but 115 points did not.  

<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline">Conclusion</h2>


This analysis suggests that at the census tract scale, there is a positive relationship between percent cover of green space and the rate of owner occupied homes when the two are compared to each other using a simple linear model. However, when the two variables are assessed for spatial autocorrelation, only a weak positive association is found which, across Baltimore City, is not statistically significant. 

Despite this mixed result, it would be incorrect and harmful to use this finding to conclude that areas with low rates of homeownership have equal access to green space as wealthier neighborhoods with high homeownership rates. This is because using only proximity as a measure for access, as this analysis did, fails to address the many other factors that impact accessibility13. There are many other factors that contribute to whether or not a space is accessible. For green spaces, examples include maintenance issues, such as when a trail is overgrown or hard to find, a playground is unsafe, or trash and debris are not regularly picked up14. Discrepancies between proximity and actual travel distance required also limit proximity’s  usefulness as a measure of accessibility, for oftentimes a green space may be located nearby but the shortest travel route to it requires traveling across potentially unsafe barriers or entering through limited and predetermined access points that may not be conveniently located for all15. These are only a few examples that highlight why conducting spatial analyses that measure accessibility can be quite tricky.

My name is Kyra (Kee-ra) Madunich, and my goal is to support creative, community-led and informed strategies for building healthy communities. I am a skilled writer with a background in biology and environmental science. I've worked in communications and outreach at multiple non-profits and, most recently, earned my M.S. degree in Geography and Environmental Systems from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Welcome to my page!
